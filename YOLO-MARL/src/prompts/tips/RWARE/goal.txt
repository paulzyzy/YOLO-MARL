Your task is to create a planning function and a reward function that work together to improve how agents cooperate. The planning function should help each agent reach its goal, and the reward function should encourage them to work smoothly together. Both functions should follow the guide from <tips> and focus on making the agents pick-up shelves and deliver them to a workstation, and then agents can return them to empty shelf locations.
