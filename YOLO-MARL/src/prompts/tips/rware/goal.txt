Your task is to create a planning function and a reward function that work together to improve how agents cooperate. The planning function should help each agent complete task, and the reward function should encourage them to work smoothly together. Both functions should follow the guide from <tips> and focus on making the agents pick-up empty shelves and deliver them to the workstation location, and then agents need to return them to the return location.
