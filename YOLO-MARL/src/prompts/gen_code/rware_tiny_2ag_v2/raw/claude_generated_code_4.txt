Thank you for providing the detailed information about the RWARE environment and the required function formats. I'll now generate the planning_function and compute_reward function based on the given instructions and environment description. Here's my step-by-step thinking:

1. Information provided in processed_states:
   - Agent information (location, carrying status, direction, movement capabilities)
   - Empty shelf positions
   - Return locations
   - Workstation locations

2. Strategy analysis:
   - Prioritize finding and delivering empty shelves to workstations
   - Efficiently return shelves after delivery
   - Coordinate agents to avoid conflicts and maximize efficiency
   - Balance exploration and exploitation

Now, I'll generate the two functions:

<code>
def planning_function(processed_state):
    """
    Determines optimal tasks for each agent based on the current state.
    
    Args:
        processed_state: A dictionary containing global information for each agent and the positions of empty shelves observed by any agent.

    Returns:
        dict: Optimal tasks for each agent ('random explore','empty shelf','workstation','return')
    """
    agent_infos = processed_state['agent_infos']
    empty_shelves_pos = processed_state['empty_shelves_pos']
    return_locations = processed_state['return location']
    workstation_locations = processed_state['workstation location']

    tasks = {}
    for i, agent_info in enumerate(agent_infos):
        agent_key = f'agent_{i}'
        
        if agent_info['is_carrying_shelf']:
            if agent_info['status of carried shelf']:
                tasks[agent_key] = 'return'
            else:
                tasks[agent_key] = 'workstation'
        else:
            if empty_shelves_pos:
                tasks[agent_key] = 'empty shelf'
            else:
                tasks[agent_key] = 'random explore'

    return tasks

def compute_reward(processed_state, llm_actions, actions):
    """
    Calculate rewards based on the tasks assigned and their outcomes.
    
    Args:
        processed_state: returned from function process_state(state, p, f)
        llm_actions (dict): dictionary of list of integers which means the suggest actions from llm for each agent.
        actions (dict): dictionary of a integer action that actually perform by each agent.
        
    Returns:
        reward: Dict containing rewards for each agent.
    """
    reward = {}
    agent_infos = processed_state['agent_infos']
    workstation_locations = processed_state['workstation location']
    return_locations = processed_state['return location']

    for agent_key, agent_action in actions.items():
        agent_index = int(agent_key.split('_')[1])
        agent_info = agent_infos[agent_index]
        agent_location = agent_info['location']
        
        # Base reward
        reward[agent_key] = 0
        
        # Reward for following LLM suggestion
        if agent_action in llm_actions[agent_key]:
            reward[agent_key] += 0.1
        
        # Reward for successful interactions
        if agent_action == 4:  # Load/Unload action
            if agent_info['is_carrying_shelf']:
                if any(agent_location == wl for wl in workstation_locations):
                    reward[agent_key] += 1.0  # Reward for delivering to workstation
                elif any(agent_location == rl for rl in return_locations):
                    reward[agent_key] += 0.5  # Reward for returning shelf
            else:
                if processed_state['empty_shelves_pos'] and any(agent_location == es for es in processed_state['empty_shelves_pos']):
                    reward[agent_key] += 0.5  # Reward for picking up empty shelf

        # Penalty for inaction
        if agent_action == 0:  # Noop action
            reward[agent_key] -= 0.1

    return reward
</code>

These functions work together to improve agent cooperation:

1. The planning_function assigns tasks based on the current state, prioritizing empty shelf delivery and efficient returns.

2. The compute_reward function encourages:
   - Following LLM suggestions
   - Successful shelf interactions (pickup, delivery, return)
   - Penalizes inaction

This approach should lead to improved cooperation between agents in the RWARE environment.
