I understand the requirements and will generate the planning_function and compute_reward function based on the given information and guidelines. Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. Information provided in processed_states:
   - agent_infos: Contains location, carrying status, direction, movement ability, and shelf status for each agent.
   - empty_shelves_pos: Positions of observed empty shelves.
   - return location: Positions where shelves can be returned.
   - workstation location: Positions where empty shelves need to be delivered.

2. Strategy for coordination:
   - Assign tasks based on agent positions and current state.
   - Prioritize delivering empty shelves to workstations.
   - Ensure efficient return of shelves after delivery.
   - Avoid conflicts between agents and promote cooperation.

Now, let's generate the two functions:

<code>
def planning_function(processed_state):
    """
    Determines optimal tasks for each agent based on the current state.
    
    Args:
        processed_state: A dictionary containing global information for each agent and the positions of empty shelves observed by any agent.

    Returns:
        dict: Optimal tasks for each agent ('random explore','empty shelf','workstation','return')
    """
    tasks = {}
    agent_infos = processed_state['agent_infos']
    empty_shelves = processed_state['empty_shelves_pos']
    workstations = processed_state['workstation location']
    return_locations = processed_state['return location']

    for i, agent in enumerate(agent_infos):
        if agent['is_carrying_shelf']:
            if agent['status of carried shelf']:
                # If carrying a non-empty shelf, go to return location
                tasks[f'agent_{i}'] = 'return'
            else:
                # If carrying an empty shelf, go to workstation
                tasks[f'agent_{i}'] = 'workstation'
        else:
            if empty_shelves:
                # If there are empty shelves, go fetch one
                tasks[f'agent_{i}'] = 'empty shelf'
            else:
                # If no empty shelves, explore randomly
                tasks[f'agent_{i}'] = 'random explore'

    return tasks

def compute_reward(processed_state, llm_actions, actions):
    """
    Calculate rewards based on the tasks assigned and their outcomes.
    
    Args:
        processed_state: returned from function process_state(state, p, f)
        llm_actions (dict): dictionary of list of integers which means the suggest actions from llm for each agent.
        actions (dict): dictionary of a integer action that actually perform by each agent.
        
    Returns:
        reward: Dict containing rewards for each agent.
    """
    rewards = {}
    agent_infos = processed_state['agent_infos']
    workstations = processed_state['workstation location']
    return_locations = processed_state['return location']

    for i, (agent, llm_action, action) in enumerate(zip(agent_infos, llm_actions.values(), actions.values())):
        reward = 0
        
        # Reward for following LLM suggestion
        if action in llm_action:
            reward += 0.1
        
        # Reward for successful load/unload
        if action == 4:
            if agent['is_carrying_shelf']:
                if any(agent['location'] == workstation for workstation in workstations):
                    reward += 1.0  # Successfully delivered to workstation
                elif any(agent['location'] == return_loc for return_loc in return_locations):
                    reward += 0.5  # Successfully returned shelf
            else:
                if not agent['can_place_shelf']:
                    reward += 0.3  # Successfully loaded a shelf

        # Penalty for incorrect load/unload attempt
        elif action == 4 and agent['can_place_shelf']:
            reward -= 0.2

        # Small reward for moving (to encourage exploration)
        elif action in [1, 2, 3]:
            reward += 0.05

        rewards[f'agent_{i}'] = reward

    return rewards
</code>

These functions aim to coordinate the agents effectively:

1. The planning_function assigns tasks based on the current state of each agent and the environment. It prioritizes delivering empty shelves to workstations and returning non-empty shelves.

2. The compute_reward function encourages agents to follow the LLM suggestions, rewards successful load/unload actions, and provides small incentives for movement to promote exploration. It also penalizes incorrect load/unload attempts.

This approach should lead to efficient coordination between agents in picking up empty shelves, delivering them to workstations, and returning them to the designated locations.
