I understand the task and will generate the planning and reward functions based on the provided information and guidelines. Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. Information in processed_states:
   - Agent information (location, carrying status, direction, movement ability)
   - Empty shelf positions
   - Return locations
   - Workstation locations

2. Strategy analysis:
   - Prioritize finding and delivering empty shelves
   - Efficiently return shelves to designated locations
   - Coordinate agents to avoid conflicts and maximize efficiency
   - Balance exploration and targeted movement

Now, I'll generate the two functions:

<code>
def planning_function(processed_state):
    """
    Determines optimal tasks for each agent based on the current state.
    
    Args:
        processed_state: A dictionary containing global information for each agent and the positions of empty shelves observed by any agent.
    
    Returns:
        dict: Optimal tasks for each agent ('random explore','empty shelf','workstation','return')
    """
    agent_infos = processed_state['agent_infos']
    empty_shelves = processed_state['empty_shelves_pos']
    workstations = processed_state['workstation location']
    return_locations = processed_state.get('return location', [])
    
    tasks = {}
    
    for i, agent in enumerate(agent_infos):
        agent_name = f'agent_{i}'
        
        if not agent['is_carrying_shelf']:
            if empty_shelves:
                nearest_shelf = min(empty_shelves, key=lambda shelf: sum(abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(agent['location'], shelf)))
                tasks[agent_name] = 'empty shelf'
            else:
                tasks[agent_name] = 'random explore'
        elif agent['is_carrying_shelf'] and not agent['status of carried shelf']:
            tasks[agent_name] = 'workstation'
        elif agent['is_carrying_shelf'] and agent['status of carried shelf']:
            if return_locations:
                tasks[agent_name] = 'return'
            else:
                tasks[agent_name] = 'random explore'
    
    return tasks

def compute_reward(processed_state, llm_actions, actions):
    """
    Calculate rewards based on the tasks assigned and their outcomes.
    
    Args:
        processed_state: returned from function process_state(state, p, f)
        llm_actions (dict): dictionary of list of integers which means the suggest actions from llm for each agent.
        actions (dict): dictionary of a integer action that actually perform by each agent.
        
    Returns:
        reward: Dict containing rewards for each agent.
    """
    rewards = {}
    agent_infos = processed_state['agent_infos']
    workstations = processed_state['workstation location']
    return_locations = processed_state.get('return location', [])
    
    for agent_name, agent_action in actions.items():
        agent_index = int(agent_name.split('_')[1])
        agent = agent_infos[agent_index]
        reward = 0
        
        # Reward for following LLM suggestions
        if agent_action in llm_actions[agent_name]:
            reward += 0.1
        
        # Reward for productive actions
        if agent_action == 4:  # Load/Unload action
            if agent['location'] in processed_state['empty_shelves_pos'] and not agent['is_carrying_shelf']:
                reward += 1  # Picking up an empty shelf
            elif agent['location'] in workstations and agent['is_carrying_shelf'] and not agent['status of carried shelf']:
                reward += 2  # Delivering an empty shelf to workstation
            elif agent['location'] in return_locations and agent['is_carrying_shelf'] and agent['status of carried shelf']:
                reward += 1.5  # Returning a shelf
        
        # Penalty for unnecessary movements when carrying a shelf
        if agent['is_carrying_shelf'] and agent_action in [1, 2, 3]:
            reward -= 0.1
        
        rewards[agent_name] = reward
    
    return rewards
</code>

These functions aim to coordinate the agents effectively:

1. The planning function prioritizes finding and delivering empty shelves, then returning them. It assigns tasks based on the agent's current state and the environment.

2. The reward function encourages:
   - Following LLM suggestions
   - Picking up empty shelves
   - Delivering empty shelves to workstations
   - Returning shelves to return locations
   - Efficient movement (by penalizing unnecessary movements when carrying shelves)

This approach should lead to effective cooperation between agents in completing the warehouse tasks.
