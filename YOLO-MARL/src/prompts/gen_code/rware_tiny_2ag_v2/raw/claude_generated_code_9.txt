Thank you for providing the detailed information about the environment, game rules, and task requirements. I'll create the planning function and reward function as requested, focusing on efficient coordination between the agents to pick up empty shelves, deliver them to workstations, and return them to the designated locations. Here are the two functions:

<code>
def planning_function(processed_state):
    """
    Determines optimal tasks for each agent based on the current state.
    
    Args:
        processed_state: A dictionary containing global information for each agent and the positions of empty shelves observed by any agent.

    Returns:
        dict: Optimal tasks for each agent ('random explore','empty shelf','workstation','return')
    """
    agent_infos = processed_state['agent_infos']
    empty_shelves_pos = processed_state['empty_shelves_pos']
    return_locations = processed_state.get('return location', [])
    workstation_locations = processed_state.get('workstation location', [])

    llm_tasks = {}

    for i, agent_info in enumerate(agent_infos):
        agent_key = f"agent_{i}"
        is_carrying_shelf = agent_info['is_carrying_shelf']
        status_of_carried_shelf = agent_info.get('status of carried shelf', False)

        if is_carrying_shelf:
            if status_of_carried_shelf:
                llm_tasks[agent_key] = "return"
            else:
                llm_tasks[agent_key] = "workstation"
        else:
            if empty_shelves_pos:
                llm_tasks[agent_key] = "empty shelf"
            else:
                llm_tasks[agent_key] = "random explore"

    return llm_tasks

def compute_reward(processed_state, llm_actions, actions):
    """
    Calculate rewards based on the tasks assigned and their outcomes.
    
    Args:
        processed_state: returned from function process_state(state, p, f)
        llm_actions (dict): dictionary of list of integers which means the suggest actions from llm for each agent.
        actions (dict): dictionary of a integer action that actually perform by each agent.
        
    Returns:
        reward: Dict containing rewards for each agent.
    """
    reward = {}
    agent_infos = processed_state['agent_infos']

    for agent_key, action in actions.items():
        agent_index = int(agent_key.split('_')[1])
        agent_info = agent_infos[agent_index]
        suggested_actions = llm_actions[agent_key]

        base_reward = 0

        # Reward for following LLM suggestions
        if action in suggested_actions:
            base_reward += 0.1

        # Reward for successful shelf operations
        if action == 4:  # Load/Unload Shelf action
            if agent_info['is_carrying_shelf']:
                if any(np.array_equal(agent_info['location'], loc) for loc in processed_state.get('workstation location', [])):
                    base_reward += 1.0  # Successfully delivered to workstation
                elif any(np.array_equal(agent_info['location'], loc) for loc in processed_state.get('return location', [])):
                    base_reward += 0.5  # Successfully returned to return location
            else:
                if agent_info['location'] in processed_state.get('empty_shelves_pos', []):
                    base_reward += 0.5  # Successfully picked up an empty shelf

        # Penalty for collisions or invalid moves
        if action == 1 and not agent_info['can_move_forward']:
            base_reward -= 0.2

        reward[agent_key] = base_reward

    return reward

These functions are designed to work together to improve agent cooperation in the RWARE environment. The planning function assigns tasks based on the current state of each agent and the environment, while the reward function encourages agents to follow the assigned tasks and complete objectives efficiently.

The planning function prioritizes delivering empty shelves to workstations and returning non-empty shelves. When agents are not carrying shelves, they are directed to pick up empty shelves if available, or explore randomly if no empty shelves are visible.

The reward function provides positive reinforcement for following LLM suggestions, successfully completing shelf operations (pickup, delivery, and return), and penalties for collisions or invalid moves. This encourages agents to work together effectively and complete their assigned tasks.
