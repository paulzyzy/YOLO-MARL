I understand the task and requirements. Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. Information provided in processed_states:
   - Agent locations, directions, and whether they're carrying shelves
   - Positions of empty shelves
   - Workstation locations
   - Return locations
   - Status of carried shelves (empty or not)

2. Strategy analysis:
   - Prioritize finding and delivering empty shelves
   - Coordinate agents to avoid conflicts and optimize efficiency
   - Balance exploration and targeted movement
   - Encourage agents to complete their assigned tasks

Now, let's generate the two functions:

<code>
def planning_function(processed_state):
    """
    Determines optimal tasks for each agent based on the current state.
    """
    agent_infos = processed_state['agent_infos']
    empty_shelves_pos = processed_state['empty_shelves_pos']
    workstation_locations = processed_state['workstation location']
    return_locations = processed_state['return location']

    tasks = {}
    available_agents = []

    for i, agent in enumerate(agent_infos):
        agent_key = f'agent_{i}'
        if not agent['is_carrying_shelf']:
            available_agents.append((i, agent['location']))

        if agent['is_carrying_shelf']:
            if agent['status of carried shelf']:
                tasks[agent_key] = 'return'
            else:
                tasks[agent_key] = 'workstation'
        else:
            tasks[agent_key] = 'random explore'

    if empty_shelves_pos and available_agents:
        closest_agent = min(available_agents, key=lambda x: min(abs(x[1][0] - shelf[0]) + abs(x[1][1] - shelf[1]) for shelf in empty_shelves_pos))
        tasks[f'agent_{closest_agent[0]}'] = 'empty shelf'

    return tasks

def compute_reward(processed_state, llm_actions, actions):
    """
    Calculate rewards based on the tasks assigned and their outcomes.
    """
    rewards = {}
    agent_infos = processed_state['agent_infos']
    empty_shelves_pos = processed_state['empty_shelves_pos']
    workstation_locations = processed_state['workstation location']
    return_locations = processed_state['return location']

    for i, (agent_info, llm_action, action) in enumerate(zip(agent_infos, llm_actions.values(), actions.values())):
        agent_key = f'agent_{i}'
        reward = 0

        # Reward for following LLM suggestions
        if action in llm_action:
            reward += 0.1

        # Reward for task completion
        if action == 4:  # Load/Unload action
            if not agent_info['is_carrying_shelf']:
                if agent_info['location'] in empty_shelves_pos:
                    reward += 1.0  # Successfully picked up an empty shelf
            else:
                if agent_info['location'] in workstation_locations and not agent_info['status of carried shelf']:
                    reward += 2.0  # Successfully delivered an empty shelf to workstation
                elif agent_info['location'] in return_locations and agent_info['status of carried shelf']:
                    reward += 1.5  # Successfully returned a non-empty shelf

        # Penalty for incorrect actions
        if agent_info['is_carrying_shelf'] and action == 4 and agent_info['location'] not in workstation_locations + return_locations:
            reward -= 0.5  # Penalize for trying to unload at incorrect location

        # Encourage exploration when not carrying a shelf
        if not agent_info['is_carrying_shelf'] and action in [1, 2, 3]:
            reward += 0.05

        rewards[agent_key] = reward

    return rewards
</code>

These functions work together to improve agent cooperation:

1. The planning function assigns tasks based on the current state, prioritizing empty shelf collection and delivery.
2. The reward function encourages following LLM suggestions, completing tasks, and exploring efficiently.
3. Both functions consider the positions of empty shelves, workstations, and return locations to guide agent behavior.
4. The reward function provides higher rewards for successful deliveries and returns, promoting the main objective.
5. Penalties are applied for incorrect actions to discourage undesirable behavior.
6. Exploration is encouraged when agents are not carrying shelves, helping to discover new empty shelves.

This approach should lead to improved cooperation between agents in completing the warehouse tasks efficiently.
