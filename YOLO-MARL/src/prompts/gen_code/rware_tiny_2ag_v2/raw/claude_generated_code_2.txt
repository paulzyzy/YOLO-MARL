I've carefully considered the environment description, game rules, and provided information. Here's my attempt at creating the planning and reward functions that aim to improve agent cooperation and task completion:

<code>

    Args:
        processed_state: A dictionary containing global information for each agent and the positions of empty shelves observed by any agent.

        dict: Optimal tasks for each agent ('random explore','empty shelf','workstation','return')
    """
    llm_tasks = {}

        agent_name = f'agent_{i}'

These functions aim to improve agent cooperation by:
1. Assigning diverse tasks to avoid conflicts.
2. Rewarding agents for following suggestions and completing tasks.
3. Encouraging exploration when no clear tasks are available.
4. Providing rewards for coordinated actions between agents.
5. Penalizing unnecessary actions to promote efficiency.

The planning function assigns tasks based on the current state and tries to avoid conflicts by diversifying tasks when possible. The reward function provides incentives for following the plan, completing objectives, and working cooperatively with the other agent.
