I understand the task and the provided information. Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. Information in processed_states:
   - Agent positions, directions, and status (carrying shelf or not)
   - Empty shelf positions
   - Return locations
   - Workstation locations

2. Strategy analysis:
   - Agents should prioritize picking up empty shelves
   - Deliver empty shelves to workstations
   - Return non-empty shelves to return locations
   - Avoid conflicts between agents
   - Explore when no immediate tasks are available

Now, let's generate the two functions:

<code>

    """
    Determines optimal tasks for each agent based on the current state.
    
    Args:
        processed_state: A dictionary containing global information for each agent and the positions of empty shelves observed by any agent.

These functions work together to improve agent cooperation:

1. The planning function assigns tasks based on the current state, prioritizing empty shelf pickup, delivery to workstations, and returning non-empty shelves. It also avoids conflicts by assigning different shelves to different agents.

2. The reward function encourages agents to follow the LLM suggestions and rewards progress towards their assigned tasks. It provides larger rewards for completing key objectives (picking up empty shelves, delivering to workstations, returning non-empty shelves) and smaller rewards for making progress towards these objectives.

This approach should lead to efficient cooperation between agents in the warehouse environment.
