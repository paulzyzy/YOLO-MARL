Thank you for providing all the necessary information. I've carefully analyzed the environment description, game rules, and the provided code structures. Based on this analysis, I'll create a planning function and a reward function that work together to improve agent cooperation in picking up empty shelves, delivering them to workstations, and returning them to the return location. Here's the step-by-step thought process and the resulting functions:

1. Information in processed_states:
   - Agent locations, carrying status, direction, movement capabilities
   - Empty shelf positions
   - Workstation locations
   - Return locations

2. Strategies for coordination:
   - Prioritize picking up empty shelves
   - Avoid multiple agents targeting the same shelf
   - Encourage efficient delivery to workstations
   - Promote returning shelves to return locations
   - Balance exploration when no immediate tasks are available

Now, let's implement these strategies in the planning and reward functions:

<code>
def planning_function(processed_state):
    """
    Determines optimal tasks for each agent based on the current state.
    
    Args:
        processed_state: A dictionary containing global information for each agent and the positions of empty shelves observed by any agent.

    Returns:
        dict: Optimal tasks for each agent ('random explore','empty shelf','workstation','return')
    """
    tasks = {}
    agent_infos = processed_state['agent_infos']
    empty_shelves = processed_state['empty_shelves_pos']
    workstations = processed_state['workstation location']
    return_locations = processed_state['return location']

    # Sort agents by their distance to the nearest empty shelf
    agents_sorted = sorted(range(len(agent_infos)), 
                           key=lambda i: min([manhattan_distance(agent_infos[i]['location'], shelf) 
                                              for shelf in empty_shelves]) if empty_shelves else float('inf'))

    for i in agents_sorted:
        agent = f"agent_{i}"
        agent_info = agent_infos[i]

        if agent_info['is_carrying_shelf']:
            if agent_info['status of carried shelf']:
                # If carrying a non-empty shelf, go to return location
                tasks[agent] = 'return'
            else:
                # If carrying an empty shelf, go to workstation
                tasks[agent] = 'workstation'
        else:
            if empty_shelves:
                # If there are empty shelves and agent is not carrying, go to nearest empty shelf
                tasks[agent] = 'empty shelf'
                # Remove this shelf from the list to avoid multiple agents targeting the same shelf
                empty_shelves.pop(0)
            else:
                # If no empty shelves, explore randomly
                tasks[agent] = 'random explore'

    return tasks

def compute_reward(processed_state, llm_actions, actions):
    """
    Calculate rewards based on the tasks assigned and their outcomes.
    
    Args:
        processed_state: returned from function process_state(state, p, f)
        llm_actions (dict): dictionary of list of integers which means the suggest actions from llm for each agent.
        actions (dict): dictionary of a integer action that actually perform by each agent.
        
    Returns:
        reward: Dict containing rewards for each agent.
    """
    rewards = {}
    agent_infos = processed_state['agent_infos']
    empty_shelves = processed_state['empty_shelves_pos']
    workstations = processed_state['workstation location']
    return_locations = processed_state['return location']

    for agent, action in actions.items():
        i = int(agent.split('_')[1])
        agent_info = agent_infos[i]
        reward = 0

        # Reward for following LLM suggestions
        if action in llm_actions[agent]:
            reward += 0.1

        # Reward for picking up empty shelves
        if action == 4 and not agent_info['is_carrying_shelf'] and agent_info['location'] in empty_shelves:
            reward += 1

        # Reward for delivering to workstation
        if action == 4 and agent_info['is_carrying_shelf'] and not agent_info['status of carried shelf'] and agent_info['location'] in workstations:
            reward += 2

        # Reward for returning to return location
        if action == 4 and agent_info['is_carrying_shelf'] and agent_info['status of carried shelf'] and agent_info['location'] in return_locations:
            reward += 1.5

        # Penalty for inaction
        if action == 0:
            reward -= 0.1

        rewards[agent] = reward

    return rewards

def manhattan_distance(pos1, pos2):
    return abs(pos1[0] - pos2[0]) + abs(pos1[1] - pos2[1])
</code>

These functions work together to improve agent cooperation:

1. The planning function prioritizes tasks based on the current state, ensuring that agents are assigned to pick up empty shelves, deliver them to workstations, and return non-empty shelves efficiently.

2. The reward function encourages desired behaviors by providing positive rewards for completing tasks and following LLM suggestions, while also penalizing inaction.

3. Both functions take into account the positions of empty shelves, workstations, and return locations to make informed decisions and provide appropriate rewards.

4. The planning function avoids assigning multiple agents to the same empty shelf by removing assigned shelves from the list.

5. The reward function provides higher rewards for more critical tasks (e.g., delivering to workstations) to encourage efficient completion of the main objective.

These functions should work together to improve how agents cooperate in picking up empty shelves, delivering them to workstations, and returning them to the designated locations.
