I understand the task and will generate the planning and reward functions based on the provided information and requirements. Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. Information provided in processed_states:
   - Agent information (location, carrying status, direction, movement capabilities)
   - Empty shelf positions
   - Return locations
   - Workstation locations

2. Strategy analysis:
   - Prioritize picking up empty shelves
   - Deliver empty shelves to workstations
   - Return shelves to return locations
   - Coordinate agents to avoid conflicts and optimize movements

Now, let's generate the two functions:

<code>
def planning_function(processed_state):
    """
    Determines optimal tasks for each agent based on the current state.
    
    Args:
        processed_state: A dictionary containing global information for each agent and the positions of empty shelves observed by any agent.

    Returns:
        dict: Optimal tasks for each agent ('random explore','empty shelf','workstation','return')
    """
    llm_tasks = {}
    agent_infos = processed_state['agent_infos']
    empty_shelves_pos = processed_state['empty_shelves_pos']
    return_locations = processed_state.get('return location', [])
    workstation_locations = processed_state.get('workstation location', [])

    for i, agent_info in enumerate(agent_infos):
        agent_key = f'agent_{i}'
        
        if agent_info['is_carrying_shelf']:
            if agent_info['status of carried shelf']:
                # If carrying a non-empty shelf, return it
                llm_tasks[agent_key] = 'return'
            else:
                # If carrying an empty shelf, deliver to workstation
                llm_tasks[agent_key] = 'workstation'
        else:
            if empty_shelves_pos:
                # If there are empty shelves, go pick one up
                llm_tasks[agent_key] = 'empty shelf'
            else:
                # If no empty shelves visible, explore randomly
                llm_tasks[agent_key] = 'random explore'

    return llm_tasks

def compute_reward(processed_state, llm_actions, actions):
    """
    Calculate rewards based on the tasks assigned and their outcomes.
    
    Args:
        processed_state: returned from function process_state(state, p, f)
        llm_actions (dict): dictionary of list of integers which means the suggest actions from llm for each agent.
        actions (dict): dictionary of a integer action that actually perform by each agent.
        
    Returns:
        reward: Dict containing rewards for each agent.
    """
    reward = {}
    agent_infos = processed_state['agent_infos']
    empty_shelves_pos = processed_state['empty_shelves_pos']
    return_locations = processed_state.get('return location', [])
    workstation_locations = processed_state.get('workstation location', [])

    for agent_key, action in actions.items():
        agent_index = int(agent_key.split('_')[1])
        agent_info = agent_infos[agent_index]
        suggested_actions = llm_actions[agent_key]
        
        base_reward = 0
        
        # Reward for following LLM suggestions
        if action in suggested_actions:
            base_reward += 0.1
        
        # Reward for successful actions
        if action == 4:  # Load/Unload action
            if agent_info['is_carrying_shelf']:
                if agent_info['location'] in workstation_locations:
                    base_reward += 1.0  # Successfully delivered to workstation
                elif agent_info['location'] in return_locations:
                    base_reward += 0.5  # Successfully returned shelf
            else:
                if agent_info['location'] in empty_shelves_pos:
                    base_reward += 0.5  # Successfully picked up empty shelf

        # Penalty for inaction
        if action == 0:  # Noop
            base_reward -= 0.1

        reward[agent_key] = base_reward

    return reward
</code>

These functions work together to improve agent cooperation:

1. The planning function assigns tasks based on the current state, prioritizing empty shelf pickup, delivery to workstations, and returning shelves.

2. The reward function encourages:
   - Following LLM suggestions
   - Successful task completion (pickup, delivery, return)
   - Penalizes inaction

This approach should lead to efficient coordination between agents in the warehouse environment.
