Based on the environment description and game rules provided, I'll outline a strategy for the two agents in the RWARE environment to efficiently deliver empty shelves and return them.

Goal: Maximize the delivery of empty shelves to workstations and their subsequent return to designated locations.

Approach:

1. Agent Role Assignment:
   - Agent A: Primary explorer and empty shelf locator
   - Agent B: Secondary explorer and workstation/return point specialist

2. Exploration and Shelf Location:
   - Both agents start with random exploration if no empty shelves are visible
   - Agent A prioritizes finding empty shelves
   - Agent B focuses on identifying workstation and return locations

3. Empty Shelf Retrieval:
   - When an empty shelf is located, the nearest available agent moves to retrieve it
   - If both agents are equidistant, Agent A takes priority

4. Delivery Process:
   - The agent carrying an empty shelf navigates to the nearest workstation
   - The other agent continues exploration or moves towards known return locations

5. Return Process:
   - After delivery, the agent at the workstation waits for the shelf to be emptied
   - Once empty, the agent returns the shelf to the nearest return location

6. Coordination and Communication:
   - Agents share information about discovered empty shelves, workstations, and return locations
   - They coordinate movements to avoid collisions and optimize paths

Scenario Adaptations:

1. Both agents not carrying shelves:
   - Prioritize exploration and empty shelf location
   - Agent A focuses on shelf discovery, Agent B on workstation/return point mapping

2. One agent carrying an empty shelf:
   - Carrying agent navigates to nearest workstation
   - Free agent continues exploration or moves to known return locations

3. One agent carrying a non-empty shelf:
   - Carrying agent immediately heads to nearest return location
   - Free agent prioritizes finding new empty shelves

4. Both agents carrying shelves:
   - Agent with empty shelf prioritizes workstation delivery
   - Agent with non-empty shelf heads to return location

5. Single empty shelf observed:
   - Nearest non-carrying agent is assigned to retrieve it
   - Other agent continues current task or prepares for next step in process

Task Breakdown:

Agent A:
1. Explore warehouse, prioritizing empty shelf discovery
2. Retrieve nearest empty shelf when found
3. Deliver empty shelf to workstation
4. Return empty shelf to return location
5. Share discovered shelf/location information with Agent B

Agent B:
1. Explore warehouse, focusing on workstation and return location mapping
2. Assist in empty shelf retrieval when needed
3. Deliver empty shelves to workstations when Agent A is occupied
4. Return empty shelves to return locations
5. Share discovered location information with Agent A

By following this strategy, the agents should efficiently coordinate their actions to maximize the delivery and return of empty shelves in the RWARE environment.
