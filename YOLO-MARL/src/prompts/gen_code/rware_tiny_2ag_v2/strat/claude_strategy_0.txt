Based on the environment description and game rules provided, here's a concise, clear, and actionable set of instructions for the agents in the RWARE environment:

1. Goal: Efficiently pick up empty shelves, deliver them to the workstation, and return them to the designated return location.

2. Problem: Coordinating two agents to navigate the warehouse, avoid collisions, and optimize the delivery process.

3. Approach / Methodology:
   a. Scan the environment for empty shelves
   b. Navigate to and pick up empty shelves
   c. Deliver empty shelves to the workstation
   d. Return shelves to the designated return location
   e. Repeat the process

4. Scenarios and Adaptations:
   a. If not carrying a shelf:
      - Search for the nearest empty shelf
      - Navigate using the most direct path (can move beneath shelves)
   b. If carrying an empty shelf:
      - Navigate to the workstation using corridors
      - Avoid other shelves and agents
   c. If carrying a non-empty shelf:
      - Navigate to the return location using corridors
      - Avoid other shelves and agents

5. Task Breakdown:
   Agent 1:
   - Focus on picking up empty shelves from one half of the warehouse
   - Deliver to workstation when an empty shelf is found
   - Return shelves to the designated return location

   Agent 2:
   - Focus on picking up empty shelves from the other half of the warehouse
   - Deliver to workstation when an empty shelf is found
   - Return shelves to the designated return location

   Coordination:
   - Communicate intended paths to avoid collisions
   - If both agents are near the same empty shelf, the closer one should pursue it
   - Alternate use of the workstation and return location to prevent bottlenecks

Action Priorities:
1. If not carrying a shelf: Move towards the nearest empty shelf
2. If carrying an empty shelf: Move towards the workstation
3. If at workstation with an empty shelf: Unload the shelf
4. If carrying a non-empty shelf: Move towards the return location
5. If at return location with a non-empty shelf: Unload the shelf
6. Rotate to face the intended direction of movement
7. Move forward when path is clear

By following these instructions, the agents should efficiently coordinate their actions to pick up, deliver, and return shelves in the warehouse environment.
